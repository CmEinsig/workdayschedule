# workdayschedule
A work day scheduler to help keep you on track 

## Description
My motivation for this project was to test my new skills in Jquery. I built this project to create a simple work day scheduler. This solved the problem of having a scheduler I could use online. I learned that it's pkay to step away and come back when things don't look right; that's when you find the answers to the bugs in your code.
